# _Grocery List_

#### _jQuery to create grocery list from user input_

#### By _**Stephanie Gurung & Maldon Meehan**_

## Description

Groceries
* Create a form that allows a user to input items they need at the store.
* When the user submits the form, hide the form and display the list of items in alphabetical order, all uppercased.

Hint: To do this, build an array of the inputted items. (Make sure you don't include any blank fields.) Sort the array in alphabetical order. Make a new array with each entry uppercased (don't just uppercase them when you display them). Then, display the sorted list of things as list items inside a <ul>.

Explore the arrays entry of the Mozilla Developer Network JavaScript documentation to research what method might be used to sort arrays.
